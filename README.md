# 02-Text-Adventure

This is a Text Adventure based game I created for the second Project of MSCH-G220 Game Technology!

You've been studying as the apprentice of an esteemed Wizard who lives in a Tower, but now your beloved mentor has gotten terribly ill with a magical sickness and you must find the potion to cure him! Can you explore the Tower and find the items you'll need to save the Wizard?

Movement is generally based around interacting with major entryways such as doors, sub-areas like a chest, and movement through the tower based around the staircases. It is a Tower after all. And yes, the kind of 'fairy-tale tower' thats cylindrical with a pointed cone roof.'

It should be a neat little adventure for you to play around with, Death Not Included, and should respond well to your input. Hopefully.
I am a novice coder after all. Things go wrong or weird sometimes.
